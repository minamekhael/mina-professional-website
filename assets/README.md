# Assets

Place personalized media in this directory to complete the portfolio experience.

- `Mina_Mekhael_Resume.pdf` — the downloadable resume referenced in the hero section.
- `hero-portrait.jpg` (optional) — a cropped or stylized portrait used for the hero background if you choose to update the CSS with a background image.
- Any additional imagery (project screenshots, badges, etc.) that you reference from `index.html`.

> Tip: Keep filenames descriptive and update paths in the HTML/CSS whenever you swap in new assets.
